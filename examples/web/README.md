## Web Example

For Parsec Web SDK documentation see [/sdk/web](/sdk/web). Usage of the SDK can be found in [main.js](main.js).

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run the development server. This project was tested with `node 8.12.0 LTS`.

```bash
node server.js
```

The development server will be running at `localhost:9000`.
